**Community Builder & Transparency Enthusiast**

Hi there! I'm Houno Minp — I love helping blockchain projects communicate clearly, stay honest, and build open communities around real education and on-chain transparency.

### A Bit About Me
I'm focused on making complex blockchain concepts accessible to beginners through clear writing, consistent documentation, and active, non-hype community engagement. Transparency isn't just a buzzword for me — it's the foundation of trust in decentralized systems.

### My Role in USI Moonik Token (USI)
USI Moonik Token is an intentionally simple, fixed-supply BEP-20 token created exclusively as an educational reference on BNB Smart Chain. It showcases immutable contracts, zero fees, full verifiability — and nothing more. **This is not an investment, security, or profit vehicle in any way.**

**Key Responsibilities I Handle:**
- Managing and growing official community channels (Telegram, X, Medium, Bitcointalk, Instagram, Facebook)
- Writing, editing, and updating all public documentation (whitepaper expansions, READMEs, compliance statements)
- Creating educational content and announcements that always emphasize non-financial, transparency-focused messaging
- Monitoring community feedback and ensuring responses align with on-chain facts and project philosophy
- Coordinating cross-channel consistency so all info matches the verified contract and official sources

My goal is to keep every interaction open, factual, and helpful for learners — never misleading or promotional.
